# How do Maker Deal works?

> Maker Deal is a core of smart contracts _(for now)_ focused on providing a good and safe way for building a decentralized marketplace. The main concepts that you should start to get familiar with are: 

## Deals 
The deals are the heart of the maker deal project, a deal is a contract that provides tokenization for a product, creating a unique article for each unique person that generates a deal. Deals are the guardians of the objects that you buy or sell, so you can sleep well at night as everybody can see your product from any part of the world. 
- **Deals are connected to the IPFS**: If blockchains are very good for storing data, why not save all the images from the deals into the same contract? Well, storing images on the blockchain is not a good idea, that's why each contract is connected to a unique IPFS hash of your files, so no one could delete them.
- **Each deal is 100% backed**: No matter which article is at the sale, every one of them is backed with cryptocurrencies that worth the same as the product that you're buying. If somebody tries to scam you, you could easily post a solver and wait for its resolution. Even with the safety measures from the project you should be careful with your funds, remember that this is an experimental project. 

## Deal Pools
A Deal Pool is a contract that helps customers matches with sellers, imagine that you're in Mexico, you wouldn't buy something in North Dakota and that's why a deal pool was made for: multiple deals near a location of reference are grouped in a single place, so you don't have to worry about finding the location, maker deal is in charge of searching the best for you.
- **Anybody can create a pool**: Every person who holds deal tokens, has the opportunity for creating pools, if you create a pool you could be a pool manager and earn rewards helping users with their solvers. 
- **Fully customizable**: Circumstances can change from place to place, that's why the deal pool design could permit changing the parameters of how it works: fees, penalizations, or rewards. 
- **Guardians of the guardians**: Deal pools are also the contracts in charge of keeping safe the balance backed by the sellers and deliver payments to them or their customers.
